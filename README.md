MSB, the Military Commercial Joint Stock Bank, presents an intriguing investment case. Despite being undervalued, it boasts significant profit potential. According to Graham’s valuation, each MSB stock should be priced at 15,000 thousand Vietnamese dong. However, the current market price hovers around 11,000 thousand dong, with fluctuations between 10,000 and 12,000 thousand dong. The low P/B, P/E, and P/S ratios further emphasize the stock’s undervaluation. Additionally, MSB’s impressive Net Profit Margin in the second quarter of 2024 indicates efficient management and sustained profitability. As investors, we should closely monitor this hidden gem
